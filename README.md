# Omnik-pvoutput
Upload data (current output and Total output of today) from inverter status.js to pvoutput 

Change the value's in script to match your inverter.

Works perfectly with my Omnik 4K-TL3

Needs curl to work ( apt install curl)

Added support to change the web version to 1.0.23 and add a website login credentials
which has been tested with an Omniksol 5K-TL3
